st.markdown("""
- Students tend to rely more on certain study techniques, such as reading notes and group study.
- Techniques perceived as more effective are not always the most frequently used.
- A positive relationship exists between the frequent use of some techniques and their effectiveness.
- Study preferences and study time vary, suggesting the need for flexible learning strategies.
